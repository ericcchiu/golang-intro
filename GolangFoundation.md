## Introduction
Go(Golang) was created by Google in November of 2009 originally to be an amazing procedural language for scalable cloud software. It was built to be simple and fast. 

### Use Cases:
* System Admin scripts
* Web app that serves HTML pages
* File server
* Scripts that deploy code to environments

### Why Go?

* It's simple. The overarching reason behind every feature is readability. 

* It compiles down to binaries so deploying is simple.

* It comes with only the basic structures and methods. Add packages only as needed. This allows the source code to remain light weight. 

* It comes with an auto formatter, so spacing is not an argument on teams. 
* Basic testing is built-in

* Concurrency is made easy for the developer. No thread management needed. The design of communication eliminates race conditions.

* It comes with all the things you need to make a server.

* Version 1 is completely backwards compativle, as promised. 

* Interfaces allow for abstraction, easy testability (through Dependency Injection), and the Adapter Pattern.

* Consisten documentation found at [golang.org/doc](https://golang.org/doc/)
