## Lab 1: If Statements

In the `ifthen.go` file solve the following with if-then-else statements

```text
Given a random number in x: 

When x is between 1 and 25, 
Then print "First Quarter"

When x is between 26 and 50
Then print "Second Quarter"

When x is between 51 and 100
Then print "Second Half"

When nothing else matches 
Then print "Out of range"

```

When you are ready to test your code, you can run `go run ifthen.go`.

## Lab 2: Switch Statements

Working in `switch.go`. Using the same criteria as in lab1:

```text
Given a random number in x:

When x is between 1 and 25,
Then print "First Quarter"

When x is between 26 and 50,
THen print "Second Quarter"

When x is between 51 and 100, 
Then print "Second Half"

When nothing else matches
Then print "Out of range"
```

Meet the requirements using a switch statement. 

**Lab 3: Loops**

Work in the file: `loop.go` in your editor. 

Solve the following `fizzbuzz` with a loop:

```text
Given numbers between between 0 and 100

When the number is divisible by 3 
Then print "fizz"

When the number is divisible by 5
Then print "buzz"

When the number is divisible by both
Then print "fizzbuzz"

When the number is not divisible by 5 or 3
Then do nothing
```

To test the code run `go run loop.go` in the directory with your `loop.go` file.
